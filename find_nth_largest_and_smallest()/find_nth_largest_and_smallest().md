### Code Snippet: Nth Largest and Smallest Element Finder

#### Inputs
The code snippet prompts the user to enter a list of numbers separated by commas and the position 'N' from the largest or smallest element.

#### Flow
1. The code snippet takes input from the user, expecting a list of numbers separated by commas and the position 'N'.
2. It splits the input string to obtain the list of numbers.
3. It converts the list of strings to a list of integers.
4. It sorts the list in descending order to find the Nth largest element and in ascending order to find the Nth smallest element.
5. It prints the Nth largest and Nth smallest elements.

#### Outputs
The code snippet outputs the Nth largest and Nth smallest elements from the entered list.

```python
# Getting the input from the user
L = input("Enter list of numbers separated by comma: ").split(",")
N = int(input("Enter Nth position from largest or smallest: "))

# Converting string to int
L = [int(i) for i in L]

# Finding Nth largest element
L.sort(reverse=True)
largest = L[N-1]
print(f"{N} largest is = {largest}")

# Finding Nth smallest element
L.sort()
smallest = L[N-1]
print(f"{N} smallest is = {smallest}")
