## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `account_number`: a string representing the account number
- `initial_balance`: a float representing the initial balance of the account
- `account_holder`: a string representing the name of the account holder
- `amount`: a float representing the amount to deposit or withdraw
- `choice`: a string representing the user's choice of operation
___
### Flow
1. The program starts by defining a class called `BankAccount` with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance of an account.
2. The `create_account` function prompts the user to enter the account number, initial balance, and account holder's name, and returns a new `BankAccount` object with the provided information.
3. The `main` function initializes an empty list called `accounts` and enters a loop to repeatedly prompt the user for their choice of operation.
4. If the user chooses to create an account (choice 1), the `create_account` function is called and the resulting account object is appended to the `accounts` list.
5. If the user chooses to deposit (choice 2), the program prompts for the account number and deposit amount, and then searches for the corresponding account in the `accounts` list. If found, the `deposit` method of the account object is called with the provided amount.
6. If the user chooses to withdraw (choice 3), the program prompts for the account number and withdrawal amount, and then searches for the corresponding account in the `accounts` list. If found, the `withdraw` method of the account object is called with the provided amount.
7. If the user chooses to check the balance (choice 4), the program prompts for the account number and searches for the corresponding account in the `accounts` list. If found, the `check_balance` method of the account object is called.
8. If the user chooses to exit (choice 5), the program breaks out of the loop and terminates.
9. If the user enters an invalid choice, an error message is displayed.

### Outputs
