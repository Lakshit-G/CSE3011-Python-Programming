## Summary
The code snippet takes a list of integers as input from the user, converts it into a set, and then compares the length of the set with the length of the original list to determine if there are any duplicate elements in the list.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter the list elements: 1 2 3 4 5
No, list does not contain duplicate element

Enter the list elements: 1 2 3 4 4
Yes, list contains duplicate element
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- A list of integers entered by the user.
___
### Flow
1. The code prompts the user to enter the list elements.
2. The input is split into individual elements and converted into a list of integers using the `map()` function.
3. The list is then converted into a set using the `set()` function.
4. The code compares the length of the set with the length of the original list.
5. If the lengths are equal, it means there are no duplicate elements in the list and the code prints "No, list does not contain duplicate element".
6. If the lengths are not equal, it means there are duplicate elements in the list and the code prints "Yes, list contains duplicate element".
___
### Outputs
- "No, list does not contain duplicate element" if there are no duplicate elements in the list.
- "Yes, list contains duplicate element" if there are duplicate elements in the list.
___
