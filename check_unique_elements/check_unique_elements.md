The code snippet takes input from the user for the number of elements and then prompts the user to enter each element. It appends the unique elements to a list. Finally, it checks if the length of the unique elements list is equal to the number of elements entered by the user and prints whether all elements are unique or not.

Inputs
======

*   number\_of\_elements: an integer representing the number of elements to be entered by the user.
    
*   element: an integer representing each element entered by the user.
    

Flow
====

1.  The code prompts the user to enter the number of elements.
    
2.  It initializes an empty list called unique\_elements\_list.
    
3.  It enters a loop that runs 'number\_of\_elements' times.
    
4.  Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter an element.
    
5.  If the entered element is not already present in the unique\_elements\_list, it appends it to the list.
    
6.  After the loop ends, it checks if the length of the unique\_elements\_list is equal to 'number\_of\_elements'.
    
7.  If the lengths are equal, it prints "All elements are unique".
    
8.  Otherwise, it prints "Not all elements are unique".
    

Outputs
=======

*   "All elements are unique" if all the entered elements are unique.
    
*   "Not all elements are unique" if there are duplicate elements among the entered elements.

In this example, the user enters 5 elements: 1, 2, 3, 2, and 4. Since the element 2 is repeated, the code outputs "Not all elements are unique".
