## Summary
The code snippet takes two sorted lists as input from the user and finds the union of the two lists. The union is a new list that contains all the unique elements from both lists, while maintaining the order.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter first sorted list of elements separated by comma: 1, 2, 3, 4
Enter second sorted list of elements separated by comma: 3, 4, 5, 6
Union of the lists:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- Two sorted lists of integers
___
### Flow
1. The user is prompted to enter the first sorted list of elements.
2. The user is prompted to enter the second sorted list of elements.
3. An empty list called `union_list` is initialized to store the union of the two lists.
4. Two variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 to keep track of the current index in each list.
5. A while loop is used to iterate through both lists until either one of them is fully traversed.
6. Inside the loop, the code compares the elements at the current indices of both lists.
7. If the element in the first list is smaller, it is added to the `union_list` if it is not already present, and `i` is incremented.
8. If the element in the second list is smaller, it is added to the `union_list` if it is not already present, and `j` is incremented.
9. If the elements are equal, the element from the first list is added to the `union_list` if it is not already present, and both `i` and `j` are incremented.
10. After the while loop, any remaining elements in either list are added to the `union_list`.
11. The final `union_list` is printed as the union of the two lists.
___
### Outputs
- The union of the two input lists as a new list.
