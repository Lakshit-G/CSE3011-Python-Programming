## Summary
The `rotate_right` function takes a list of elements and an integer `k` as inputs. It rotates the elements to the right by `k` positions and returns the rotated list.

## Example Usage
```python
elements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 2
rotated_elements = rotate_right(elements, k)
print(rotated_elements)
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `elements`: a list of elements to be rotated.
- `k`: an integer representing the number of positions to rotate the elements.
___
### Flow
1. Get the length of the `elements` list and assign it to the variable `n`.
2. Calculate the remainder of `k` divided by `n` and assign it to the variable `k`.
3. Return a new list by concatenating the sublist of `elements` from index `n-k` to the end with the sublist of `elements` from index 0 to `n-k`.
___
### Outputs
- `rotated_elements`: a list containing the elements of `elements` rotated to the right by `k` positions.
