___
### Flow
1. The code snippet uses a nested loop to iterate over the rows and columns.
2. The outer loop iterates 4 times, representing the number of rows.
3. The inner loop iterates 10 times, representing the number of columns.
4. In each iteration of the inner loop, an asterisk followed by a space is printed.
5. After printing all the asterisks in a row, a newline character is printed to move to the next row.
___
### Outputs
