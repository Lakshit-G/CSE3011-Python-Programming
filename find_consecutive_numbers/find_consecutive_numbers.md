## Summary
The code snippet takes a list of numbers and a number N as input. It then checks if there are any consecutive sequences of N numbers in the list. If there are, it stores the numbers that are repeated N times consecutively in a separate list called 'consecutive_numbers'. Finally, it prints 'YES' followed by the 'consecutive_numbers' list if there are any consecutive sequences, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter the list of numbers separated by space: 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 5 5 5
Enter the number of consecutive numbers: 3
YES
[2, 5]
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- A list of numbers
- An integer N representing the number of consecutive numbers to check for
___
### Flow
1. Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers separated by space.
2. Prompt the user to enter the number of consecutive numbers to check for.
3. Initialize an empty list called 'consecutive_numbers' to store the numbers that are repeated N times consecutively.
4. Iterate through the list from index 0 to len(L)-N+1.
5. For each index i, initialize a variable 'count' to 1.
6. Iterate through the sublist from index i+1 to i+N.
7. If the current number is not equal to the previous number, break out of the inner loop.
8. If the inner loop completes without breaking, increment 'count' by 1.
9. If 'count' is equal to N and the current number is not already in 'consecutive_numbers', append the current number to 'consecutive_numbers'.
10. Check if 'consecutive_numbers' is not empty.
11. If it is not empty, print 'YES' followed by 'consecutive_numbers'.
12. If it is empty, print 'NO'.
___
### Outputs
- If there are any consecutive sequences of N numbers in the list, the code snippet will print 'YES' followed by the 'consecutive_numbers' list.
- If there are no consecutive sequences, the code snippet will print 'NO'.
