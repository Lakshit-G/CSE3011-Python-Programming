## Summary
The code snippet is a simple program that takes user input to create a list of elements, calculates the sum of all the elements in the list, and then prints the sum.

## Example Usage
```python
Enter number of elements: 4
Enter an element: 2
Enter an element: 5
Enter an element: 1
Enter an element: 3
Sum of all elements: 11
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- The user is prompted to enter the number of elements they want to input.
- The user is then prompted to enter each element one by one.
___
### Flow
1. The code snippet prompts the user to enter the number of elements.
2. It creates an empty list called `elements_list`.
3. It uses a for loop to iterate `number_of_elements` times.
4. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter an element and appends it to `elements_list`.
5. It initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0.
6. It uses another for loop to iterate over each item in `elements_list`.
7. Inside the loop, it adds each item to `total_sum`.
8. Finally, it prints the sum of all the elements in `elements_list`.
___
### Outputs
- The code snippet prints the sum of all the elements in the list.
