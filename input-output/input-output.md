## Code Explanation

The provided Python code snippet is a part of a script that takes a user's input, splits the input into individual string integers, converts them to integers, and prints each one. If a value cannot be converted to an integer, it prints a message indicating that the value is not an integer.

### Inputs

The code snippet takes a string input from the user, which should contain integers separated by spaces.

### Flow

1. The code prompts the user to enter integers separated by spaces.
2. The input string is split into individual string integers using the `split()` method.
3. Each string integer is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.
4. If the conversion is successful, the integer is printed.
5. If the conversion fails (i.e., the string cannot be converted to an integer), a message indicating that the value is not an integer is printed.

### Outputs

The code snippet prints each integer value entered by the user on a separate line. If a value cannot be converted to an integer, it prints a message indicating that the value is not an integer.

### Usage example

```python
Enter integers separated by spaces: 10 20 30 abc 40
