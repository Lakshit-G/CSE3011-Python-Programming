## Summary
The code snippet creates a dictionary called 'squares' that contains the squares of numbers from 1 to 15. It then prints the dictionary.

## Example Usage
```python
squares = {}
for i in range(1, 16):
    squares[i] = i ** 2
print(squares)
```
Expected Output:
```
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}
```

### Inputs
- None
___
### Flow
1. Initialize an empty dictionary called 'squares'.
